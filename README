1. What is ALSQLP
-----------------

ALSQLP is a little (My)SQL parser built for modifying MySQL queries.

Given a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, REPLACE or DELETE statement, it breaks the SQL command into pieces (tokens)
and adds them to a tree. This tree structure can be modified and, by reversing the process, a new query can be built.

ALSQP has 2 components: a PHP extension written in C and a PHP class.

Both components must be installed in the development environment where a php extension can be installed.

In a production environment it may use only the pure PHP code.


2. Why it might be usefull
--------------------------

ALSQP can be used for adding/appending WHERE clauses, ORDER BY, LIMIT etc.

Also I think it might be used for a simple record level permissions functionality. In a system with users and groups,
each record may have a "owner ID" column and 3 bitmask columns showing the permissions the owner, the groups she belongs to and the other users have on the record.
Then, on every SQL query, the parser could add the apropriate boolean conditions to the WHERE clauses. The resulting query might look something like:

--some query
SELECT *
FROM ...
WHERE conditions
	--start permissions conditions
	AND (
		(id_owner=$id_owner AND (owner_permissions & $required_permissions) )
		OR
		(id_group IN $list_of_groups_the_owner_belongs_to AND (groups_permissions & $required_permissions) )
		OR
		(others_permissions & $required_permissions)
		)

3.  How to install it
---------------------

The PHP class can be stored anywhere, it is just a PHP class.
	
To compile the extension, bison (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) and flex (http://flex.sourceforge.net/) must be installed. 
There are distributions of these for both Unix and Windows systems.

	
	
To build the extension, the steps are as for any other extension with one extra step (where bison and flex generate some files).
Assuming that all executable needed are in the path, in ALSQP  C extension directory run the following:

cd C-extension
phpize 
./configure --with-alsqlp=shared

bison -v -t -d sql.y
flex -i sql.l 

make
make install
apachectl restart

The script build_alsqlp has the above commands with the full paths.

Then add to php.ini, in "Dynamic Extensions" section:

extension=alsqlp.so

4.  How it works
----------------

In a nutshell:

- SqlParser PHP class has a method called  "parse"; 
- When called with a query as parameter, it checks if alsqlp extension is installed;
- If installed, it calls parseSqlQuery which is exported by the extension and which returns a tree (an associative array). These tree is saved on the disk 
in a cache dir. It will be used in environments where alsqp extension is not installed;
- If the extension is not installed, based on the query, it identifies the coresponding cache file and loads the tree (the associative array) from the disk;
- Once loaded (from alsqp extension or from the disk) the tree can be manipulated to obtain new queries;
